    <h1>Welcome to Python</h1>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used for a variety of tasks including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
    <h2>Why use Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is easy to learn and read, making it a popular language for beginners. It has a vast standard library and many third-party modules, making it a versatile language for a variety of applications. It is also open source, meaning it is free to use and modify.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
    <p>To get started with Python, you will need to install the Python interpreter on your computer. Once you have installed Python, you can use a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Python code. There are many resources available online to help you learn Python, including tutorials, books, and online courses.</p>

    <title>Lists and Dictionaries in Python</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Lists and Dictionaries in Python</h1>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>In Python, a list is a collection of items, which can be of any data type. Lists are ordered, meaning that the items are stored in a specific sequence. To create a list, you can use square brackets [] and separate the items with commas.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        # Example of a list
        my_list = [1, 2, "three", 4.0, True]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>You can access individual items in a list by their index, which starts at 0. You can also modify, add or remove items from a list using various built-in functions and methods.</p>
    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered, meaning that the items are not stored in a specific sequence. To create a dictionary, you can use curly braces {} and separate the keys and values with colons :</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        # Example of a dictionary
        my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>You can access values in a dictionary by their keys. You can also modify, add or remove key-value pairs from a dictionary using various built-in functions and methods.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Lists and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python that can be used to store, manipulate and organize data in various ways. They are essential components of many Python programs and are widely used in various fields such as data science, machine learning, and web development.</p>

    <h1>Calculators and Guessing Game in Python</h1>
    <h2>Calculators</h2>
    <p>In Python, you can create a simple calculator by using the basic mathematical operators, such as +, -, *, and /, and the input() function to get input from the user. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        # Example of a simple calculator
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        
        sum = num1 + num2
        difference = num1 - num2
        product = num1 * num2
        quotient = num1 / num2
        
        print("Sum = ", sum)
        print("Difference = ", difference)
        print("Product = ", product)
        print("Quotient = ", quotient)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This code prompts the user to enter two numbers, performs basic mathematical operations on them, and displays the results. You can customize and expand this code to create more advanced calculators that can perform various calculations and operations.</p>
    <h2>Guessing Game</h2>
    <p>In Python, you can create a simple guessing game by using the random module to generate a random number, and the input() function to get input from the user. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        # Example of a simple guessing game
        import random
        
        num = random.randint(1, 10)
        guess = int(input("Guess the number between 1 and 10: "))
        
        if guess == num:
            print("Congratulations! You guessed the number!")
        else:
            print("Sorry, the number was ", num)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This code generates a random number between 1 and 10, prompts the user to guess the number, and checks if the guess matches the generated number. You can customize and expand this code to create more complex guessing games with multiple levels, scoring, and other features.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Calculators and guessing games are fun and useful applications that can be created using Python. They are great examples of how Python can be used to create simple and interactive programs that can perform various tasks and entertain users.</p>
